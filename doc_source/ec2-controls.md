**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical 

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check.html)

**Schedule type:** Periodic

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots are not public\. The control fails if Amazon EBS snapshots are restorable by anyone\.

EBS snapshots are used to back up the data on your EBS volumes to Amazon S3 at a specific point in time\. You can use the snapshots to restore previous states of EBS volumes\. It is rarely acceptable to share a snapshot with the public\. Typically the decision to share a snapshot publicly was made in error or without a complete understanding of the implications\. This check helps ensure that all such sharing was fully planned and intentional\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
Africa \(Cape Town\)
Europe \(Milan\)
Middle East \(UAE\)

### Remediation<a name="ec2-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your EBS snapshot to make it private instead of public\.

**To make a public EBS snapshot private**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Elastic Block Store**, choose **Snapshots** menu and then choose your public snapshot\.

1. From **Actions**, choose **Modify permissions**\.

1. Choose **Private**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add the AWS account numbers of the authorized accounts to share your snapshot with and choose **Add Permission**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## \[EC2\.2\] The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic<a name="ec2-2"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** High 

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-default-security-group-closed.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-default-security-group-closed.html)

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:** None

This control checks that the default security group of a VPC does not allow inbound or outbound traffic\.

The rules for the [default security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#DefaultSecurityGroup) allow all outbound and inbound traffic from network interfaces \(and their associated instances\) that are assigned to the same security group\.

We do not recommend using the default security group\. Because the default security group cannot be deleted, you should change the default security group rules setting to restrict inbound and outbound traffic\. This prevents unintended traffic if the default security group is accidentally configured for resources such as EC2 instances\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-2-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, create new security groups and assign those security groups to your resources\. To prevent the default security groups from being used, remove their inbound and outbound rules\.

**To create new security groups and assign them to your resources**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security groups**\. View the default security groups details to see the resources that are assigned to them\.

1. Create a set of least\-privilege security groups for the resources\. For details on how to create security groups, see [Creating a security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#CreatingSecurityGroups) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the Amazon EC2 console, change the security group for the resources that use the default security groups to the least\-privilege security group you created\. See [Changing an instance's security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SG_Changing_Group_Membership) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

After you assign the new security groups to the resources, remove the inbound and outbound rules from the default security groups\. This ensures that the default security groups are not used\.

**To remove the rules from the default security group**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security groups**\.

1. Select a default security group and choose the **Inbound rules** tab\. Choose **Edit inbound rules**\. Then delete all inbound rules\. Choose **Save rules**\.

1. Repeat the previous step for each default security group\.

1. Select a default security group and choose the **Outbound rule** tab\. Choose **Edit outbound rules**\. Then delete all outbound rules\. Choose **Save rules**\.

1. Repeat the previous step for each default security group\.

For more information, see [Working with security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#WorkingWithSecurityGroups) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## \[EC2\.3\] Attached Amazon EBS volumes should be encrypted at\-rest<a name="ec2-3"></a>

**Related requirements:** NIST\.800\-53\.r5 CA\-9\(1\), NIST\.800\-53\.r5 CM\-3\(6\), NIST\.800\-53\.r5 SC\-13, NIST\.800\-53\.r5 SC\-28, NIST\.800\-53\.r5 SC\-28\(1\), NIST\.800\-53\.r5 SC\-7\(10\), NIST\.800\-53\.r5 SI\-7\(6\)

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Encryption of data at rest

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::Volume`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/encrypted-volumes.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/encrypted-volumes.html)

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted\. To pass this check, EBS volumes must be in use and encrypted\. If the EBS volume is not attached, then it is not subject to this check\.

For an added layer of security of your sensitive data in EBS volumes, you should enable EBS encryption at rest\. Amazon EBS encryption offers a straightforward encryption solution for your EBS resources that doesn't require you to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure\. It uses KMS keys when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots\.

To learn more about Amazon EBS encryption, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
Africa \(Cape Town\)
Europe \(Milan\)
Middle East \(UAE\)

### Remediation<a name="ec2-3-remediation"></a>

There is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot\. You can only encrypt a new volume or snapshot when you create it\.

If you enabled encryption by default, Amazon EBS encrypts the resulting new volume or snapshot using your default key for Amazon EBS encryption\. Even if you have not enabled encryption by default, you can enable encryption when you create an individual volume or snapshot\. In both cases, you can override the default key for Amazon EBS encryption and choose a symmetric customer managed key\.

For more information, see [Creating an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-volume.html) and [Copying an Amazon EBS snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## \[EC2\.4\] Stopped Amazon EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period<a name="ec2-4"></a>

**Related requirements:** NIST\.800\-53\.r5 CA\-9\(1\), NIST\.800\-53\.r5 CM\-2, NIST\.800\-53\.r5 CM\-2\(2\)

**Category:** Identify > Inventory

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::Instance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-stopped-instance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-stopped-instance.html)

**Schedule type:** Periodic

**Parameters:**
+ `allowedDays`: 30

This control checks whether any EC2 instances have been stopped for more than the allowed number of days\. An EC2 instance fails this check if it is stopped for longer than the maximum allowed time period, which by default is 30 days\.

A failed finding indicates that an EC2 instance has not run for a significant period of time\. This creates a security risk because the EC2 instance is not being actively maintained \(analyzed, patched, updated\)\. If it is later launched, the lack of proper maintenance could result in unexpected issues in your AWS environment\. To safely maintain an EC2 instance over time in a nonrunning state, start it periodically for maintenance and then stop it after maintenance\. Ideally this is an automated process\. 

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
Africa \(Cape Town\)
Europe \(Milan\)
Middle East \(UAE\)

### Remediation<a name="ec2-4-remediation"></a>

You can terminate an EC2 instance using either the console or the command line\.

Before you terminate the EC2 instance, verify that you won't lose any data:
+ Check that your Amazon EBS volumes will not be deleted on termination\.
+ Copy any data that you need from your EC2 instance store volumes to Amazon EBS or Amazon S3\. 

**To terminate an EC2 instance \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose **Instances**\.

1. Select the instance, and then choose **Actions**, **Instance State**, **Terminate**\. 

1. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Yes, Terminate**\. 

**To terminate an EC2 instance \(AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell\)**  
Use one of the following commands\. For more information about the command line interface, see [Accessing Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html#access-ec2) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ From the AWS CLI, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.html)
+ From the Tools for Windows PowerShell, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html)\.

**Schedule type:** Periodic

**Parameters:**
+ `trafficType`: `REJECT`

This control checks whether Amazon VPC Flow Logs are found and enabled for VPCs\. The traffic type is set to `Reject`\. 

With the VPC Flow Logs feature, you can capture information about the IP address traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC\. After you create a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in CloudWatch Logs\. To reduce cost, you can also send your flow logs to Amazon S3\. 

Security Hub recommends that you enable flow logging for packet rejects for VPCs\. Flow logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can detect anomalous traffic or provide insight during security workflows\.

By default, the record includes values for the different components of the IP address flow, including the source, destination, and protocol\. For more information and descriptions of the log fields, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

**Note**

**Schedule type:** Periodic

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether account\-level encryption is enabled by default for Amazon Elastic Block Store\(Amazon EBS\)\. The control fails if the account level encryption is not enabled\. 

When encryption is enabled for your account, Amazon EBS volumes and snapshot copies are encrypted at rest\. This adds an additional layer of protection for your data\. For more information, see [Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

Note that following instance types do not support encryption: R1, C1, and M1\.

**Note**

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether your EC2 instance metadata version is configured with Instance Metadata Service Version 2 \(IMDSv2\)\. The control passes if `HttpTokens` is set to required for IMDSv2\. The control fails if `HttpTokens` is set to `optional`\.

You use instance metadata to configure or manage the running instance\. The IMDS provides access to temporary, frequently rotated credentials\. These credentials remove the need to hard code or distribute sensitive credentials to instances manually or programmatically\. The IMDS is attached locally to every EC2 instance\. It runs on a special "link local" IP address of 169\.254\.169\.254\. This IP address is only accessible by software that runs on the instance\.

Version 2 of the IMDS adds new protections for the following types of vulnerabilities\. These vulnerabilities could be used to try to access the IMDS\.
+ Open website application firewalls
+ Open reverse proxies
+ Server\-side request forgery \(SSRF\) vulnerabilities
+ Open Layer 3 firewalls and network address translation \(NAT\)

Security Hub recommends that you configure your EC2 instances with IMDSv2\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
Africa \(Cape Town\)
Europe \(Milan\)
Middle East \(UAE\)

### Remediation<a name="ec2-8-remediation"></a>

To remediate an EC2 instance that is not configured with IMDSv2, you can require the use of IMDSv2\.

To require IMDSv2 on an existing instance, when you request instance metadata, modify the Amazon EC2 metadata options\. Follow the instructions in [Configuring instance metadata options for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

To require the use of IMDSv2 on a new instance when you launch it, follow the instructions in [Configuring instance metadata options for new instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**To configure your new EC2 instance with IMDSv2 from the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Choose **Launch instance**, and then choose **Launch instance**\.

1. Under **Advanced details**, for **Metadata version**, choose **V2 only \(token required\)**\.

1. In the Summary panel, review your changes, and then choose **Launch instance**\.

If your software uses IMDSv1, you can reconfigure your software to use IMDSv2\. For details, see [Transitioning to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html#instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether EC2 instances have a public IP address\. The control fails if the `publicIp` field is present in the EC2 instance configuration item\. This control applies to IPv4 addresses only\. 

A public IPv4 address is an IP address that is reachable from the internet\. If you launch your instance with a public IP address, then your EC2 instance is reachable from the internet\. A private IPv4 address is an IP address that is not reachable from the internet\. You can use private IPv4 addresses for communication between EC2 instances in the same VPC or in your connected private network\.

IPv6 addresses are globally unique, and therefore are reachable from the internet\. However, by default all subnets have the IPv6 addressing attribute set to false\. For more information about IPv6, see [IP addressing in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

If you have a legitimate use case to maintain EC2 instances with public IP addresses, then you can suppress the findings from this control\. For more information about front\-end architecture options, see the [AWS Architecture Blog](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/) or the [This Is My Architecture series](http://aws.amazon.com/this-is-my-architecture/?tma.sort-by=item.additionalFields.airDate&tma.sort-order=desc&awsf.category=categories%23mobile)\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-9-remediation"></a>

Use a non\-default VPC so that your instance is not assigned a public IP address by default\.

When you launch an EC2 instance into a default VPC, it is assigned a public IP address\. When you launch an EC2 instance into a non\-default VPC, the subnet configuration determines whether it receives a public IP address\. The subnet has an attribute to determine if new EC2 instances in the subnet receive a public IP address from the public IPv4 address pool\.

You cannot manually associate or disassociate an automatically\-assigned public IP address from your EC2 instance\. To control whether your EC2 instance receives a public IP address, do one of the following:
+ Modify the public IP addressing attribute of your subnet\. For more information, see [Modifying the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#subnet-public-ip) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 
+ Enable or disable the public IP addressing feature during launch\. This overrides the subnet's public IP addressing attribute\. For more information, see[ Assign a public IPv4 address during instance launch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#public-ip-addresses) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

If your EC2 instance is associated with an Elastic IP address, then your EC2 instance is reachable from the internet\. You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from an instance or network interface at any time\.

**To disassociate an Elastic IP address**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Elastic IPs**\.

1. Select the Elastic IP address to disassociate\.

1. From **Actions**, choose **Disassociate Elastic IP address**\.

1. Choose **Disassociate**\.

**Schedule type:** Periodic

**Parameters:** 
+ `serviceName`: `ec2`

This control checks whether a service endpoint for Amazon EC2 is created for each VPC\. The control fails if a VPC does not have a VPC endpoint created for the Amazon EC2 service\. 

This control evaluates resources in single account\. It cannot describe resources that are outside of the account\. Because AWS Config and Security Hub do not conduct cross\-account checks, you will see `FAILED` findings for VPCs that are shared across accounts\. Security Hub recommends that you suppress these `FAILED` findings\.

To improve the security posture of your VPC, you can configure Amazon EC2 to use an interface VPC endpoint\. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to access Amazon EC2 API operations privately\. It restricts all network traffic between your VPC and Amazon EC2 to the Amazon network\. Because endpoints are supported within the same Region only, you cannot create an endpoint between a VPC and a service in a different Region\. This prevents unintended Amazon EC2 API calls to other Regions\. 

To learn more about creating VPC endpoints for Amazon EC2, see [Amazon EC2 and interface VPC endpoints ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/interface-vpc-endpoints.html)in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-10-remediation"></a>

**Parameters:**
+ `Adapterids` \(Optional\) – A list of network interface IDs that are attached to EC2 instances

This control checks whether an EC2 instance uses multiple Elastic Network Interfaces \(ENIs\) or Elastic Fabric Adapters \(EFAs\)\. This control passes if a single network adapter is used\. The control includes an optional parameter list to identify the allowed ENIs\.

Multiple ENIs can cause dual\-homed instances, meaning instances that have multiple subnets\. This can add network security complexity and introduce unintended network paths and access\.

This control also fails if an Amazon EKS cluster that belongs to an Amazon EKS cluster has more than one ENI\. If you need to use EC2 instances that have multiple ENIs as part of an Amazon EKS cluster, you can suppress those findings\.

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:**
+ `authorizedTcpPorts` \(Optional\) – Comma\-separated list of ports to which to allow unrestricted access\. For example: `'80, 443'`\. For this rule, the default values for `authorizedTcpPorts` are 80 and 443\.

This control checks whether the security groups that are in use allow unrestricted incoming traffic\. Optionally the rule checks whether the port numbers are listed in the `authorizedTcpPorts` parameter\.
+ If the security group rule port number allows unrestricted incoming traffic, but the port number is specified in `authorizedTcpPorts`, then the control passes\. The default value for `authorizedTcpPorts` is `80, 443`\.
+ If the security group rule port number allows unrestricted incoming traffic, but the port number is not specified in `authorizedTcpPorts` input parameter, then the control fails\.
+ If the parameter is not used, then the control fails for any security group that has an unrestricted inbound rule\.

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS\. Security group rules should follow the principal of least privileged access\. Unrestricted access \(IP address with a /0 suffix\) increases the opportunity for malicious activity such as hacking, denial\-of\-service attacks, and loss of data\.

Unless a port is specifically allowed, the port should deny unrestricted access\.

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-launch-template-public-ip-disabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-launch-template-public-ip-disabled.html)``

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:** None

This control checks if Amazon EC2 launch templates are configured to assign public IP addresses to network interfaces upon launch\. The control fails if an EC2 launch template is configured to assign a public IP address to network interfaces or if there is at least one network interface that has a public IP address\.

A public IP address is one that is reachable from the internet\. If you configure your network interfaces with a public IP address, then the resources associated with those network interfaces may be reachable from the internet\. EC2 resources shouldn't be publicly accessible because this may permit unintended access to your workloads\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions:  
China \(Beijing\)
China \(Ningxia\)
Middle East \(UAE\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)

**Schedule type:** Periodic

**Parameters:** None

This control evaluates if Amazon EBS volumes are covered by backup plans\. The control fails if an Amazon EBS volume isn't covered by a backup plan\. This control only evaluates Amazon EBS volumes that are in the `in-use` state\.

Backups help you recover more quickly from a security incident\. They also strengthen the resilience of your systems\. Including Amazon EBS volumes in a backup plan helps you protect your data from unintended loss or deletion\.

**Schedule type:** Change triggered

**Parameters:** None

This control checks if Amazon EC2 instances are launched in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. This control fails if an EC2 instance is launched in the EC2\-Classic network\.

The EC2\-Classic network retired on August 15, 2022\. The EC2\-Classic network model was flat, with public IP addresses assigned at launch time\. The EC2\-VPC network offers more scalability and security features and should be the default for launching EC2 instances\.
